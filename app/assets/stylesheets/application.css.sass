/* This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
/* listed below.

/* Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
/* or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.

/* You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
/* compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
/* defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
/* file per style scope.
